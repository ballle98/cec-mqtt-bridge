cec-mqtt-bridge
===============

A HDMI-CEC and IR to MQTT bridge written in Python 3 for connecting your AV-devices to your Home Automation system. You can control and monitor power status and volume.

# Features
* HDMI-CEC
  * Power control and feedback
  * Volume control (up/down/specific) and feedback
  * Relay HDMI-CEC messages from HDMI to broker (RX)
  * Relay HDMI-CEC messages from broker to HDMI (TX)
* IR
  * Relay IR keypresses from IR to broker (RX)
  * Relay IR keypresses from broker to IR (TX)

# Dependencies

* MQTT broker (like [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/))
  * "apt-get install mosquitto"

* python paho-mqtt module
  * https://eclipse.dev/paho/files/paho.mqtt.python/html/client.html
  * "apt-get install python3-paho-mqtt"

* python HDMI-CEC module
  * libcec4 with python bindings (https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec)
  * **NOTE: cec python package is not available on pypi**
    * "apt-get install python3-cec" OR compile the bindings yourself
  * HDMI-CEC interface device (like a [Pulse-Eight](https://www.pulse-eight.com/) device, or a Raspberry Pi)

* python LIRC module
  * lirc with python bindings (https://www.lirc.org/api-docs/html/group__python__bindings.html)
  * **NOTE: lirc python package is not available on pypi**
    * "apt-get install lirc"
    * "sudo pip install /usr/share/lirc/lirc-*.tar.gz" see #18
    * OR compile & install https://sourceforge.net/p/lirc/git/ci/master/tree/python-pkg/

* lircd + hardware to receive and send IR signals
  * cheep IR RX and TX with transistor https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251801744452143.html
  * to get RX and TX working see https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/2993#issuecomment-497420228

| `prefix`/ir/rx                 | `key`                                   | Notify that `key` was received. You have to configure `key` in the lircrc file. This format is used if the remote is not given in the config file.  |

`id` is the address (0-15) of the device on the CEC-bus.

## Examples
* `mosquitto_pub -t media/cec/volup -m ''`
* `mosquitto_pub -t media/cec/tx -m '15:44:42,15:45'`

# Configuration

You can either copy `config.default.ini` to `config.ini` and adjust its properties, or alternatively declare any of those as environment variables using the format `SECTION_KEY` (e.g., `MQTT_USER`).
